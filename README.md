60
I'm a G, I can't get G checked
In the party I step, barbies get wet
I ain't seen brodie in a sec', what the heck?
Why you think I hate the Met?
I don't live my life of regrets
No regrets, open chest
Vio, no-no, I can't accept
Hand tings get pressed if you're on my set
Four quid in a day, man 'affi invest that, stretch that
If my phone ain't on, I'm bored
I phone up bro tryna slap out headbacks
Normal day if you see us in jet black
But if you ever see me with the gang
And we're dressed like tramps, rudeboy you best get back, get back
I love a Glock, dots or the fours
But I might dinner date with a PR
Shouts out bro, he's a 60 gleer
No facemask on, LD and PR
They know who we are, wouldn't wanna be ya
Done make the waps dem sing like Aliyah
We don't mind war like North Korea
Just leave me alone, just let me sort my career
Are you taking the piss?
Of course we're trying
Why you think half of my batch on the wing?
Age don't matter when you're in them vids
You can still get chinged for runnin' them lips
Jack is shit, he shot and missed
Fill up the dings, let's take a trip
And we're coming equipped
Come round here, and we're going back round
No doubts, guarantee I'm tryna make them drown
Talking a lot while I sort my sounds
It's all fun and games 'til we get them down
Clocked-clocked my prey, jump out and pounced
Got me swinging here now or you might hear bow, bow, bow
Do it and bounce
Yeah, we do it in Fields, yeah, we do it in Town
My aqua the best, he's smokey
But he gets devious with that cutter
Two waps up on smoke, thats smoked
And came in a duo and got down Stuttz
Doner kebab when we got down Thumpz
That blade done spread his flesh like butter
Think you're bad in that fuck off jacket
Man will come round there and ruin that puffer
We was on the ends, but the back bit
Testing out bines that we got for the mac clip
In the parkside everyone's active
Real nigga flew, everyone's contracted
That's on my head, not right, I move sick
Just to do me a mad ting
With the .9mm's, do a backflip
With the .442 like a tactic
More packs pending
Rolled up a 41 when I heard about Glendon
Don't get caught by the guys on the ride
'Cause you might just end up trending
Have your name in your bro-bro's mentions, or bio
You know the gangdem can't sleep on a vio'
These Junction yutes must hate it
All they're taking is L's
They tried drill it and failed
Next week gang-gang sent my man to hell
This is real life, I ain't telling no tales
I've been sitting in jail said time would tell
Remand for an M, I didn't get no bail
I know I ain't telling no tales
I got a leng one named Rita
I'm feeling her aura, but her attitude stinks
Hop in the dings and swing, ching
Any opp I catch might swim
come dead like Reckz
Bro's too reckless, I swear he don't think
And them CT boys are miserable
Why? 'Cah we put S1 in a spliff
Yard man told me "Haffi easy"
I ain't never been no tea leaf
And ya can't tek mans tings like DV
But fuck it, lets be cheeky
'Cah I swear bro bro put a 12 in his face
Made his eye wander like Stevie
And the next man wanna put corn in the man
And his relative was doing my GG
PR held two in his back
It was a double tap
He didn't even get to do one lap
This is real rap, no cap, straight up facts
Bad man, don't take backchat
If you ain't with the gang, you could get backstrapped
R6 on the ride, coming like a satnav
We just spotted some guys, it's about to get mad
